The main goal with the first milestone is to make pharmpy an official thing to work on. To accomplish that we need some main proof of concepts and an idea of how to distribute the package.

* Create new versions of some PsN tools: execute, frem, bootstrap and parts of transform (update_inits)

* Create the APIs, classes and methods necessary for the first bullet

* How can PsN/pharmpy be distributed? Together? Separately? Installers? Windows/Mac?

* R package using reticulate to publish some initial stuff that is already useful and can attract attention.

* To attract attention it would be nice to be able to run bootstrap both with NONMEM and nlmixr

The final bullet would be a proof of concept that this could be done and it could show stakeholders that this has more added
value. We can now argue that the added values are: a good external API usable from Python and R, not fixed to NONMEM and a modern
programming paradigm that will simplify future development and enabling more advanced methodology (like parsing the NONMEM abbreviated code).
